# Demo project created by Xiaozhong Hua (Jim)
This is a demo project, starting up with "super-rentals" that https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.13.0/tutorial/ember-cli/ picks up you to create as an excellent Ember.js example. With my contribution, the framework of emberjs-super-rentals-videos can play video for each rental.

## Setup & Run

- Git clone the repository to your local site.

* ember s #### run my demo: emberjs-super-rentals-videos.

* Supposing you have experience on following the tutorial of https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.13.0/tutorial/simple-component/, and running the whole project. Then you are familiar with its screen to show all rentals as below.
